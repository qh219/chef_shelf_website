### Description
Inspired by food recipe websites such as Food.com, we have created an interactive food recipe website that has more to offer. Our website has a grid-style layout and provides many advanced search features such as search by keyword, by ingredient, and by nutrition. In addition, it allows users to create accounts and save their favorite recipes.

The database used in our website includes nine food recipe related datasets such as food recipes, nutrition information, user ratings, recipe images, and ingredient brands provided on Kaggle.com by different authors. Thanks to Express.js, React.js, and Node.js backend framework, we have integrated these datasets to provide the website users a broad spectrum of recipe information ranging from recipe to ingredient details. Each query is also optimized by arranging the sequence of join, selection, and projection to enhance the user experience.

Food is one of the most common topics for everyday life conversation. Want to make a dish for yourself or your loved ones? Visit our website! Our website is designed to help users find delicious recipes that best fit their needs.
Once navigated to our website, the users will see a beautiful home page showing some randomly picked recipes and quick links to explore some top recipe collections. The navigation bar contains home, search recipe, search ingredients, search brand, search nutrition, chef’s recommendation, statistics, about, and my account page. The users can explore our website by clicking these pages accordingly.
 
The search recipe page contains a search bar and four popular search terms. Typing keywords in the search bar and hitting the enter key will lead the users to the recipe search results. Similarly in the ingredients and brands page, the users could use the search bar and popular search terms to find the ingredients and brands of interest respectively. The nutrition page allows users to find a recipe based on nutritions and any ingredients they want to avoid. The chef’s recommendation page shows the editors’ favorite recipes. The recipe statistics page provides a platform for the users to understand the database we are using for this website. The my account page is designed for the new users to register accounts or portal users to log in to save recipes.
